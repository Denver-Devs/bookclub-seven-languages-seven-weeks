# Find out how to access files with and without code blocks. What is the benefit of the code block?
# With:
File.open('week2.txt') {|f| f.each_line {|i| puts i}}
# Without:
f = File.open('week2.txt')
f.each_line {|i| puts i}
f.close
# Code Block Advantage: 
stream will close itself

# How would you translate a hash to an array? 
hash.to_a
# Can you translate arrays to hashes?
hash = []
array.map { |i| hash[hash.count] = i }

# Can you iterate through a hash?
hash.each {|i| puts i}

# You can use Ruby arrays as stacks. What other common data structures do arrays support?
struct, dict, list, queue, etc
